\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% It is a standard exercise in beginners' functional programming courses to
% define a datatype for arithmetic expressions:
% \begin{spec}
%   data Expr a = Lit a | Expr a :+ Expr a | Expr a :Ã— Expr a {-"~~,"-}
% \end{spec}
% and define a function |Expr a -> a| to evaluate such expressions, provided that it is given
% how to perform addition and multiplication for type |a|. If we add an additional
% constructor denoting a variable, the data structure represents univariate polynomials. In this pearl, we will play around with types such as |Expr (Expr a)|, |Expr (Expr (Expr a))|... |ExprN n a|. We will claim that they are useful --- |ExprN n a| encodes a multivariate polynomial with |n| variables, and define various operations to manipulate them. Finally, we will show how such expressions can be compiled, inductively, to assembly programs that evaluates them, and prove the correctness of compilation.
%
% But let us motivate first.

A \emph{univariate polynomial} over a base ring $R$ is a finite sum of the form
\[ a_nX^n+a_{n-1}X^{n-1}+\cdots+a_0, \] where $a_i\in R$ are the
coefficients, and $X$ is called an \emph{indeterminate}.
%
The set of univariate polynomials over $R$ forms a ring, denoted as
$R[X]$.
%
We can allow two or more indeterminates $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_m$ and thus
arrive at a \emph{multivariate polynomial}, a finite sum of the form
\[ \sum_{i}a_iX_1^{e_1^{(i)}}X_2^{e_2^{(i)}}\cdots X_m^{e_m^{(i)}}, \]
where $a_i\in R$ are coefficients, and $e_j^{(i)}$ are nonnegative
integers.
%
The set of $m$-variate polynomials over $R$, denoted as
$R[X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_m]$, also forms a ring, referred to as a
\emph{ring of polynomials}.
%

%
Polynomials are a central concept to many branches in mathematics and
computer science.
%
In particular, manipulation of polynomial expressions can be used to
model a wide variety of computation.
%
For example, every element of an algebraic extension field $F$ over a
base field $K$ can be identified as a polynomial over $K$, e.g.,
cf.~Theorem~1.6, Chapter~5 of the (standard) textbook by
Hungerford~\cite{hungerford2003algebra}.
%
Addition in $F$ is simply polynomial addition over $K$, whereas
multiplication in $F$ is polynomial multiplication modulo the defining
polynomial of $F$ over $K$.
%
Let us use the familiar case of the complex numbers over the real
numbers as a concrete example.
%
The complex numbers can be obtained by adjoining to the real numbers a
root $i$ of the polynomial $X^2+1$.
%
In this case, every complex number can be identified as a polynomial
$a+bi$ for $a,b$ real.
%
The addition of $a_1+b_1i$ and $a_2+b_2i$ is simply
$(a_1+a_2)+(b_1+b_2)i$, whereas the multiplication,
$(a_1+b_1i)(a_2+b_2i)\bmod i^2+1=(a_1a_2-b_1b_2)+(a_1b_2+a_2b_1)i$.
%

%
In addition to arithmetic in an algebraic extension field,
manipulation of polynomial expressions also finds rich application in
cryptography in particular.
%
A wide variety of cryptosystems can be implemented using polynomial
expressions over a finite field or $\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$, the ring of
integers modulo $n$.
%
In elliptic curve cryptography~\cite{DBLP:conf/crypto/Miller85}, for
example, we use the group structure of certain elliptic curves over
finite fields to do cryptography, and the group laws are often given
in polynomial expressions over finite fields.
%
Another example is certain classes of post-quantum cryptosystems,
i.e., those expected to survive large quantum computers' attack.
%
Among the most promising candidates, we have multivariate
cryptosystems~\cite{conf/pqcrypto/ChenCCCY08} and several particularly
efficient lattice-based
cryptosystems~\cite{DBLP:journals/iacr/LyubashevskyPR12,DBLP:conf/ccs/CrockettP16},
for which encryption and decryption operations can be carried out
using polynomial expressions over finite fields or
$\mathbb Z/n\mathbb Z$.
%

This pearl is initially motivated by our research in cryptography.
%
On the one hand, we often have to deal with multivariate polynomials
over various base rings, as exemplified above.
%
% Complex number is just one example (todo: what else?). On the other hand, for
% efficiency, these expressions have to be compiled to assembly language,
% which usually support only arithmetic operations that fit in one machine word.
% The conversion from mathematical expressions to assembly is usually done by hand. We wish to automate this process in stages: represent multivariates in
% terms of univariates, and convert univariates over compound base rings to
% multiple univariates over simple values that are ready for compilation. And
% we wish to formally prove each of the steps correct.
%
% %
% For example, we can characterize a datatype for multivariate
% polynomials in a categorical style as outlined by, e.g., Bird and de
% Moor~\cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0096998}.
% %
% That is, we can define a base bifunctor $F$ as
% \begin{equation} \label{eq:datatype} F(A,B)=1+A+(B\times B)+(B\times
%   B). \end{equation}
% %
% Then a datatype $TA$ for (univariate) polynomials over a base ring of
% type $A$ will be $TA=F(A,TA)$, and that for multivariate polynomials
% will be $T^mA=T(T^{m-1}A)=F(T^{m-1}A,T^mA)$.
% %
% Here $T$ is a type functor, so the datatype $TA$ represents
% polynomials over datatype $A$.
%
%
%
On the other hand, we also need to compile a polynomial expression
into in a sequence of arithmetic expressions over its base ring.
%
This is useful for, e.g., software implementation of cryptosystems on
microprocessors with no native hardware support for arithmetic
operations with polynomials or integers of cryptographic sizes, which
typically range from a few hundreds to a few thousands of bits.
%
Again using multiplication of two complex numbers as an example, we
would need a sequence of real arithmetic expressions for implementing
$c_1+c_2i=(a_1+b_1i)\times(a_2+b_2i)$:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  %
\item $t_1\leftarrow a_1\times a_2$;
  %
\item $t_2\leftarrow b_1\times b_2$;
  %
\item $t_3\leftarrow a_1\times b_2$;
  %
\item $t_4\leftarrow b_1\times a_2$;
  %
\item $c_1\leftarrow t_1-t_2$;
  %
\item $c_2\leftarrow t_3+t_4$.
  %
\end{enumerate}
%
Today such compilation is mostly done manually by human programmers,
sometimes even in low-level programming languages such as assembly
languages for achieving maximal speed performance.
%
Naturally, we would like to automate this process as much as possible.
%
Furthermore, such a manual process is error-prone, so we would like to
be able to prove the correctness of such compilations, especially when
the expressions get more and more complicated in real-world
cryptographic algorithms.
%

\paragraph{From Univariate to Multivariate.}
%
A key observation on which this pearl is based is that there is an
isomorphism between multivariate polynomial ring
$R[X_1,X_2\ldots,X_m]$ and univariate polynomial ring $S[X_m]$ over
the base ring $S=R[X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_{m-1}]$, cf.~Corollary~5.7,
Chapter~3 of Hungerford~\cite{hungerford2003algebra}.
%
This allows us to define a datatype for univariate polynomials, and
reuse it inductively to define multivariate polynomials.
%
Operations such as evaluation, substitution, etc., of the latter can
also be defined inductively in terms of that of the former.
%
We will explore this design and its various implications in depth in
Section~\ref{sec:expressions}.
%
Then in Section~\ref{sec:operations}, we will present the detail of
the inductive implementation of common polynomial operations such as
evaluation, substitution, etc.
%
Finally in Section~\ref{sec:compilation}, we will conclude this pearl
by showing how we can compile polynomial expressions into a sequence
of arithmetic expressions over the base ring.
